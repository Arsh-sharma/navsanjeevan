  <h1>Women Empowerment</h1>
  
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    They work in 17 villages in Pune District and have formed 230 Self Help Groups (SHGs) to teach women skills. These SHGs identify needs of the women and give them the required training. A few examples of these skills are sewing, beauty parlor courses, and so on. These SHGs are linked to a bank that helped the trained women with any financial assistance to create their own business and assistance is given for documentation and application filing. They also provide legal assistance.

  <h2>Self Help Groups (SHGs)</h2>
  <p>
    Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have emerged as powerful platforms for women empowerment, providing them with opportunities for financial independence, skill development, and social support. These groups enable women to break free from traditional constraints and carve a path towards personal growth and collective progress. This article explores the significance of SHGs in uplifting women and fostering a positive change in society.
    Self-Help Groups have proven to be transformative spaces for women, empowering them to challenge stereotypes, gain financial independence, and actively participate in social change. By promoting women's agency, SHGs create a powerful force for gender equality and inclusive development. As we continue to support and promote SHGs, we contribute to building a more equitable and just society for women worldwide.
    They have formed a total of 230 Self Help Groups (SHGs) in the 17 villages of Pune District.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Financial Assistance</h2>
  <p>
    Through collective savings and access to microcredit facilities, SHGs empower women economically. These groups enable women to engage in income-generating activities, start small businesses, and contribute to their family's financial stability.
    As women in SHGs gain financial independence, they can invest in their children's education and provide a better future for the next generation. Educated mothers play a vital role in breaking the cycle of poverty and empowering their children.
    The SHGs are linked to a bank that provides financial assistance to the trained women to help them start their own businesses. The bank also offers support for documentation and application filing.

  <h2>Legal Assistance</h2>
  <p>
    SHGs foster a collective approach towards addressing social issues, including gender-based discrimination and violence against women. Women united in SHGs have a stronger voice to advocate for their rights and challenge societal norms.
    They provide legal assistance to the women to help them navigate any legal challenges they may face.
